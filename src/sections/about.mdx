## About

I specialize in JAMstack websites and web applications. The JAMstack is a modern approach to web development that provides a wide array of benefits like blazing fast websites, fortress-like security and being great for SEO to mention a few. These benefits generally result in a better user experience for my client's visitors, less money spent on site maintenance and a better ranking on search engines like Google or Bing.

Entrepreneurs/employers are looking for one thing: effective solutions to the problems they are facing. I have made it my life's work to be more than just a 'pretty maker' and provide my clients with real solutions to real problems. Working with me is a collaborative process filled with mutual respect, clear goals and winning solutions.
