## About

I am a freelance front-end engineer from South Africa and make myself available for working with existing teams or as a consultant/developer for entrepreneurs.

I understand that what entrepreneurs and employers are looking for are problem solvers. My goal is to provide value for my clients and not just be a 'pretty maker'. That's why I don't sell websites. Instead I provide solutions to business problems.

When working with me, you can expect a partner who is fully dedicated to moving the needle by helping solve the problems your business is facing and helping you get the results you desire.

I also always finish what I start, an trait often overlooked, so you can be at ease that your project will be completed. Working with me is a collaborative process filled with mutual respect, clear goals and winning solutions that aims to push your business to the next level.
